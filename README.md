# Schedule Manager

<b><font color="#dd0000">Note: Upgrading from version "1.0. x" to version "1.1. x" may require reopening the plugin to update the format of the schedule records</font></b>

## Introduction
The schedule management plugin manages to-do items in the form of a calendar, and currently supports multiple views such as month, week, day, and list.

The calendar is displayed as a tab and automatically creates a **Schedule Manager Notebook** in the document tree when first launched.

 >- **Please do not remove the notebook. I'm new to Vue, Typescript, etc., and have not added enough exception handling, removing the notebook may cause unnecessary trouble !!!**
